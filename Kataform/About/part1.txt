Welcome to the Kataform learning place. This course can be used a reference and a guide when working on Kataform. Please follow the following steps to start part 1.

1. You should get a basic tour from a Kataform manager. If you are viewing this doc, you have probably been contacted by a manager. If you have not been contacted or are not following a special deal, you probably should not be viewing this doc.
2. Identify your device. Based on what you told the manager, they should have told you whether you are able to run go on your computer.

Now, based on your answer for #2, do the following:

If your device is able to run go, you first want to download go and then create a go file (kataform.go)

If your device is not able to run go, create a google document and title it "Kataform Go - Your Name"

Now you are ready to move onto part 2.
