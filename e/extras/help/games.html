    <h3>Chapter One: Getting a game document set up</h3>
    <p>The very first thing you need is a document to code in. There is a lot of baseline things needed in a game, and they will be covered below. The <a download href="game.go">go file</a> can be downloaded with these things set up.</p>
    <p>After downloading and opening the go file, you will notice the declaration of three variables: SvgGame, SvgPeople and SvgMap. These variables will be key for doing things. The first thing you want to do is title your game. Around line 130, a line starts with <kbd>title.Text =</kbd>. Inside the quotes put the title of your game.</p>
    <h3>Chapter Two: Creating Your Players</h3>
    <p>Now comes the fun part of the game, only less fun than playing the finished version and creating the map. You will now generate the code to create your people. It won't be hard because of the support provided by the coding document you are using. Somewhere in the document you will find <kbd>func InitPlayer() {</kbd>. Inside of the function you will find some code that you need to modify. The first thing you need to do is decide what you want your main player to be. The main choices are Rectangle or Circle. In your code will be the following:</p>
    <br>
    <kbd>var player *svg.Rect<br><br>

func InitPlayer() {<br>
	updt := SvgGame.UpdateStart()<br>
	SvgPeople.DeleteChildren(true)<br>

	player = SvgPeople.AddNewChild(svg.KiT_Rect, "player").(*svg.Rect)<br>

	<b>player.SetProp("fill", "red")<br>
	player.SetProp("stroke", "darkred")</b><br>
	player.Size = gi.Vec2D{2, 2}<br>
	player.Pos = gi.Vec2D{-5, -10}
	<br><br>
	SvgGame.UpdateEnd(updt)
<br>
}
</kbd>
	
	<br><br>
    <p>Wherever it says *svg.Rect make it *svg.Circle or keep it Rect depending on your shape. Next set the color on the fill and stroke lines. The fill color is the inside of your shape and the stroke is the border. Next set the size and the position. Your game is on a 10 by 10 coordinate plane so keep that in mind when setting these. You can copy this code to create other players. Note: When Setting the size of a circle, make it player.Radius = number instead of player.Size = gi.Vec2D{num, num}.</p>
    <h3>Chapter Three: The Map</h3>
    <p>It has now come time for you to create the world your game will be played in. Even though it might seem like it would be very hard to configure all of this, your document will make this very easy. On your document you must first find the InitMap function, marked with <kbd>func InitMap() {</kbd>. There will be two lines of code already in the function. In the blank space between the two lines of code you will code your map. I will go through possible elements to create a basic map. You may copy the code I list below or use the functions I list below to create your map. Curently your document should say:</p>
    <br><br>
    <kbd>
      
func InitMap() {<br><br>
		updt := SvgGame.UpdateStart()<br><br><br>

	SvgGame.UpdateEnd(updt)<br><br>

}<br>
      
    </kbd>
    <br>
    <p>Let's say I want to start with a rectangle right below the middle of my map, at 0, -2. Since I want to leave things open, I will declare my variable outside of the function and then set it to be a rectangle in my function, like this:</p>
    <br><br>
    <kbd>
      
      var MiddleRect *svg.Rect
      <br><br>
      func InitMap() {<br><br>
		updt := SvgGame.UpdateStart()<br><br><br>
		
		MiddleRect = SvgMap.AddNewChild(svg.KiT_Rect, "MiddleRect").(*svg.Rect)<br>
		MiddleRect.Size = gi.Vec2D{2,2}<br>
		MiddleRect.Pos = gi.Vec2D{0,-2}<br>
		MiddleRect.Stroke = "green"<br>
		MiddleRect.Fill = "blue"

	<br><br><br>SvgGame.UpdateEnd(updt)<br><br>

}<br><br>
    </kbd>
    <p>Notice how I have set the size, position, color and fill of my rectangle. Now let's say I want to create a line at the bottom of my page in addition to my rectangle. This is what my code would look like:</p>
    <br><br>
    <kbd>
      
      var MiddleRect *svg.Rect<br>
      var BottomLine *svg.Line
      <br><br>
      func InitMap() {<br><br>
		updt := SvgGame.UpdateStart()<br><br><br>
		
		MiddleRect = SvgMap.AddNewChild(svg.KiT_Rect, "MiddleRect").(*svg.Rect)<br>
		MiddleRect.Size = gi.Vec2D{2,2}<br>
		MiddleRect.Pos = gi.Vec2D{0,-2}<br>
		MiddleRect.Stroke = "green"<br>
		MiddleRect.Fill = "blue"
		<br><br>
		
		BottomLine = SvgMap.AddNewChild(svg.KiT_Line, "BottomLine").(*svg.Line)<br>
		BottomLine.Start = gi.Vec2D{-10,-10}<br>
		BottomLine.End = gi.Vec2D{10,-10}<br>
		BottomLine.Stroke = "red"

	<br><br><br>SvgGame.UpdateEnd(updt)<br><br>

}<br><br>
    </kbd>
    <p>Notice how I use the start and end variables to set the position of my line. There is also no fill on a line so I just set stroke. Also a note, the names I am using, MiddleRect and BottomLine can be anything you want. I am just using those names as examples.</p>
