    <h1>The basics of Kataform</h1>
    <p>Kataform is an online app-based platform, coded in a programming language known as Go or Golang. You can visit the Go website at <a href="https://Golang.org" target="_blank">Golang.org</a>.</p>
    <h1>About the Guide</h1>
    <p>This guide will be in parts and will have some interactive elements to allow you to practice the Go programming language. So, let's get started for you to learn the basics of Go!</p>
    <h1>Part One: The Basics of Go</h1><br>
    
    
    <h2>Chapter One: The Header</h2>
    <p>Every Go file you code in will start the same way:</p><br><br>
    <kbd>
      package main
      <br><br>
      import (<br><br>
      bunch of junk :)<br><br>
      )
    </kbd>
    <br><br>
    <p>That code will start the document, but most likely you will be using a template so you will never have to type that code. Under the import keyword, you will put all of the <b>packages</b> you want to import. Packages will allow you to import code, like a function that you can use to generate random numbers or print stuff out in your running app. Your imports will automatically be there in whatever template you use, but you should still know the mechanics of these.</p>
    <p>You will also find that almost everything is in functions. This is something about Go and you will be coding the most within the mainrun function.</p>
    
    
    
    <h2>Oh, by the way a side note that somehow wormed its way out of a chapter: No semicolins in go, or spaces or tabs or anything else unless you want to code everything in one line.</h2>
    
    
    <h2>Chapter Two: A Basic Intro to Variables and Functions</h2>
    <h3>Functions:</h3>
    <p>There is nothing really different about functions in Go that you will need to know, except for the format of function creation (using functions is just <kbd>functionName(parameters, more parameters, third parameter if needed)</kbd>. So, here is how to declare a function in Go:</p><br>
    <kbd>func functionName(parameter names, more names, more) {<br>
    Bunch of Code
    <br>}
    </kbd><br>
    <h3>Variables:</h3>
    <p>You should already know about variables from prior coding, but there are some different rules in Go so here are ways to declare and use variables:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In any place, you can declare a variable: <kbd>var variableName = blahblahblah</kbd></li>
      <li>You should also put the type (I am using an example of the string type but there is also int, int32, int64, float32, float64 and a ton of other types): <kbd>var variableName string = "My name is Kai and this is a string"</kbd>. Notice that I have the type of string after the variable name and before the equal sign.</li>
      <li>Also, in functions <b>only</b> you can have a quicker variable creation setup: <kbd>variableName := blahblah</kbd>. Notice that you can <b><u><i>NOT</i></u></b> put a type in this way of creation.</li>
      <li>To use a variable, just put the name of the variable.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    
    <h2>Chapter Three: The Use of Printing</h2>
    <p>You will be running your apps in what is called a <b>Terminal</b>. You will type in something like <kbd>./App</kbd> into the terminal and it will run your app. If you want to debug something or see what values are, in your code you can make it so it will print those things. Here is how to put printing in your code:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First, make sure that "fmt" is in the import section.</li>
      <li>Second, in your code put: <kbd>fmt.Printf(whatever you want to put)</kbd></li>
      <li>Done!</li>
    </ul>
